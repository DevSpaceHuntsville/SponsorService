# SponsorService
Microservice to manage sponsorship related data

# Architecture
This service is a stand-alone service that is meant to function inside a Docker container that will be hosted by a Azure Container App.

# Historical Note
The original version of the project used Azure Functions as a serverless app. That version has been deprecated. The code is in the `azure-functions` branch for historical purposes.
